\description{
A data frame with an example of raw consistency test data that are
compatible with the synr package's `create_participantgroup_widedata` function,
with data for three participants from a test that included three
graphemes ("A", "D", 7) and two responses
per grapheme. More graphemes and/or
responses per grapheme can be handled by the package (though participant
plots do not function correctly if there are more than three responses
per grapheme)
